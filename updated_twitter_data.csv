It‚Äôs like something straight out of a tech thriller.Let‚Äôs talk about SegWit (activated in 2017). This soft fork forever changed Bitcoin by separating the digital ‚Äúwitness‚Äù data from the transaction data. Why was this needed? Because without it, the network was haunted by the threat of transaction malleability, where users could alter transaction IDs, creating chaos. Plus, this change freed up space in each block, meaning more transactions could fit and the network could handle more users.The effect? Bitcoin became more scalable and secure, and this update laid the foundation for features like the Lightning Network‚Äîtaking Bitcoin to the next level. SegWit was the portal that kept our favorite cryptocurrency safe from lurking threats and brought it closer to mass adoption.#SpookySoftForks",en,0.0,0.0,1.0,2024-11-02 02:10:04.715000,POSITIVE,0.9864697456359863,0.108,0.747,0.145,0.6895

The Board‚Äôs adoption of this new policy follows the recent restructuring of its Board to include experts in Blockchain and Web3 technologies.The Company‚Äôs Board of Directors have approved the following Bitcoin-first strategy:(1) To commit 90% or more of our current and future reserves to be held in Bitcoin(2) Commence utilizing our $150 million ATM to acquire an initial target of $120 million in Bitcoin, to be held for the long term as its primary treasury reserve asset(3) Launch our Web3 Wealth Renaissance education series for students to accelerate their understanding of Bitcoin, Cryptocurrency and Blockchain with Genius Group‚Äôs AI-powered guides.(4) Enable Bitcoin payments globally on the Company‚Äôs Edtech platform.Thomas Power, Genius Group Director and previously Board Director at Team Blockchain and the Blockchain Industry Compliance and Regulation Association (BICRA), said ‚ÄúGenius Group is focused on educating students for the exponential technologies of the future. We see Bitcoin as being the primary store of value that will power these exponential technologies."" ""The compelling case that we believe Michael Saylor and Microstrategy have made for public companies to invest in Bitcoin as their primary treasury reserve asset is one that we fully endorse.‚Äù‚ÄúWe believe with our Bitcoin-first strategy, we will be among the first NYSE American listed companies to fully embrace Microstrategy‚Äôs Bitcoin strategy, for the benefit of our shareholders.‚ÄùIan Putter, Genius Group Director and previously Head of Blockchain Domain at Standard Bank and founder of the Blockchain Research Institute Africa, a think tank that collaborated with research institutes across the globe to identify blockchain use-cases relevant to Africa, said ‚ÄúGenius Group has an approved $150 million ATM funding facility, and the Board intends to put our future earnings and capital raising to good use in building a sizeable reserve in Bitcoin, to strengthen our balance sheet and shareholder returns.""""Being a Singapore-incorporated company, with 0% capital gains tax, gives us an additional advantage in our Bitcoin-first strategy.‚ÄùRoger Hamilton, Genius Group‚Äôs CEO, said ‚ÄúGenius Group has been in a two-year public battle against market manipulators, in which it has seen its share price drop to under $0.60 and its market capitalization drop to $12 million, despite reporting audited annual revenue in 2023 of $23 million and total assets of $43 million.‚Äù‚ÄúThe Company has pending litigation against alleged market manipulators, led by Wes Christian, with alleged damages estimated at over $250 million, and we believe every step the Company can make to embrace transparent, decentralized, blockchain-based technology is an opportunity to reset Genius Group‚Äôs share price commensurate with its value.‚Äù‚ÄúWe believe a new type of future-focused, AI-driven, blockchain-based public listed companies can bridge the divide for investors between the current, centralized and regulated world of NYSE, NASDAQ and other stock markets with the future promise of decentralized, exponential economies."" ""Genius Group‚Äôs unique position of already educating for the future gives us an opportunity to bring a layer of added value through education, where we prepare the next generation for a world in which how they earn and learn are dramatically different.‚ÄùGenius Group will be holding a GeniusLIVE podcast featuring Roger Hamilton, Thomas Power and Ian Putter which will go into detail on Genius Group‚Äôs AI-powered, Bitcoin-first plan at 9am ET on Tuesday, 19 November 2024.
